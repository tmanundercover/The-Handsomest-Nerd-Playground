# Technical Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed design for the "Production-Ready Landing Page for The Handsomest Nerd Inc." (THN), based on the requirements and UX/UI guidelines provided in docs/User-Prompt-README.md and associated internal documentation. This design will enable granular division of tasks and ensure a stunning, production-grade landing page without any errors.

## Architecture Diagram (describe)
- Modern React (possibly Next.js) single-page application
- Strict use of styled-components for all UI elements
- Modular organization: `/components`, `/assets`, `/pages`, `/styles`
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Full SSO accessibility and SEO compliance
- Backendless for landing page (scalable Firebase integration for analytics, contact form, etc.)
- Deployment: Vercel (or Firebase Hosting), automated CI/CD

## Granular Technical Requirements List

- [ ] Setup project skeleton with create-react-app or Next.js, TypeScript, strict linting, Prettier, `.editorconfig`
- [ ] Routing for Home (Landing), and secondary pages if needed
- [ ] Global theme derived from color/typography system in design doc
- [ ] Responsive layout using prescribed spacing, breakpoints, and box-shadow
- [ ] Styled-components with global and local style files

- [ ] Button hover and focus SVG/logging features (see doc code)
- [ ] Footer with multi-agent credits and legal links
- [ ] SEO Metadata and OG tags, Google Fonts integration

### 2. Backend/API (Firebase for analytics/contact form)
- [ ] Set up Firebase project; enable analytics and (optionally) Firestore for contact form
- [ ] API routes for form submission (or use Firebase Functions/Firebase Forms)
- [ ] Store/track events for CTA clicks, conversions, hero/interactions in analytics
- [ ] Provide GDPR-compliant privacy page (if needed)

### 3. UI/UX & Graphic Design
- [ ] Static assets: SVGs for hero/brand, png mockups
- [ ] Responsive grid system, min/max widths from design
- [ ] Typography and style resets per design doc
- [ ] Ensure all animation and color transitions per spec
- [ ] Accessible labeling for all primary/secondary UI
- [ ] Full documentation for new SVG assets (naming, color use)

### 4. DevOps/Deployment
- [ ] Automated build/deploy: Vercel/Firebase, with preview URLs and PR branch deploys
- [ ] Environment variable handling for analytics keys, etc.
- [ ] Lint/style/test in CI before deploy
- [ ] .env.sample with documentation

### 5. Documentation/Repo Management
- [ ] Coding style guide based on docs/coding-style-guide-README.md
- [ ] Graphics style guide from docs/graphics-style-guide-README.md
- [ ] Comprehensive README: ./docs/how-to-use-README.md
- [ ] Issue templates and PR templates in .github/

### 6. QA/Testing
- [ ] Jest/React Testing Library coverage for all components
- [ ] Accessibility tests and performance benchmarks
- [ ] User testing feedback route implemented

### 7. Analytics/Tracking
- [ ] Track impression, unique, and detailed CTA click events in Firebase Analytics
- [ ] Custom events for interactive SVGs and button rows
- [ ] KPI collection for major flows (e.g., lead form submission)

### 8. Accessibility
- [ ] ARIA-labels and focus states throughout
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation, tab order as per design
- [ ] Color contrast and WCAG compliance

### 9. SEO & Social
- [ ] OG, Twitter, and meta tags for previews
- [ ] Sitemap generation (if non-SPA)
- [ ] Alt text and descriptive metadata for every SVG/asset

### 10. Legal/Compliance
- [ ] Credit all agents in multi-agent footer (with SVG avatars?)
- [ ] Links to privacy, ToS, and compliance for analytics

### 11. Project Management
- [ ] All requirements must be atomized into <10 file-requirement issues. Any API must have a dedicated issue per documented endpoint and UI state.
- [ ] All design and API doc text is preserved in issues with NO summarization.
- [ ] If a requirement likely touches more than 10 files, break it into separate issues.
