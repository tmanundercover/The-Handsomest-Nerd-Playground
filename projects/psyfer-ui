# make a gpt interface to market our "The Handsomest Nerd 
(with our partner TenK Solutions) One page React Application 
Generator" Workflow to a potential client and future 
partner Psyfer. Psyfer creates websites for clients 
in html, css, and plain js for dependability. our 
Application Generator workflow Creates a One page React 
application in one App.tsx without the need for 
external files. then it spits out a link to a codesandbox set up with the project.The backend is mocked in miragejs with production level detail with leading 
comments to create the actual api in firebase v2 
functions environment using the Controller Service 
Repository pattern. give me the order of the 
agents and what their user prompts should be along 
the way. the system promot will be about the agents and what their jobs are just to give the agent context l. the user prompt tells the agent who they are and what they need to do. i dont want actual jest tests in the final 
output i just want the application App.tsx but with the dependability if jest tests... that 
app.tsx then goes into an agent designed to split 
the massive app.tsx file into its componet parts to 
build a codesandbox sandbox with the create-react-app template to translate to a that will preview a 
production level working preview of the application 
in codesandbox. please give me the SERIAL workflow in our 
json format and our agents(only terrell, james, brian, nat, compass, josh, reqqy)that will do this. 
consider i have an http Post enpoint that accepts 
an object in codesandbox "define" endpoint format. 
and returns the split files. i have a ui that will 
submit the users prompt to generate a one page react 
app to the workflow. the ui then displays the 
onepage app.tsx and you have options to 
copy(for paste to codesandbox), view
codesanbox(i have an endpoint that accepts the 
define post body and creates a sandbox AND RETURNS A link to the sandbox.
